JAX compatibility
********************************************************************************

JAX provides a NumPy-like API, which combines automatic differentiation and the
Accelerated Linear Algebra (XLA) compiler to achieve high-performance machine
learning at scale.

JAX uses composable transformations of Python+NumPy through just-in-time (JIT)
compilation, automatic vectorization, and parallelization.

To learn about JAX, including profiling and optimizations, refer to the
`JAX documentation <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html>`_.
